The taste for overcrowded flower and fruit still lifes became outmoded at the end of the 18th century. HenriÃ«tte Geertruida Knip responded to this change, painting watercolours like this one with only a few kinds of blossoms and, moreover, omitting the vase. Her elegant flower pieces were extremely popular. One of her watercolours even won a silver medal in Paris in 1819.
